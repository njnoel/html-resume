<h1>Mini Project : RSA Algorithm</h1>
<p>
    The RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) algorithm stands as one of the most widely used and robust public-key cryptosystems. It relies on a pair of keys, a public key used for encryption and a corresponding private key for decryption. This asymmetrical key structure forms the basis of its security.</p>
    <h2>Key Components:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Public Key:</b>This key is openly distributed and used for encryption by anyone who wishes to send an encrypted message to the owner of the associated private key. The public key is derived from the product of two large prime numbers and an exponent.</li>
        <li><b>Private Key:</b>Kept confidential by the owner, this key is used for decrypting messages encrypted with the associated public key. It is generated from the same two large prime numbers and an exponent, but with different parameters.</li>
    </ol>
