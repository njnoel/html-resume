<h1>Main Project: Evaluation of Queuing Systems</h1>
<p>An evaluation of a queuing system in the context of computer networks and systems involves analyzing how data packets or requests are managed and processed within a network. Queuing theory, a branch of mathematics, plays a pivotal role in understanding and optimizing the performance of such systems.</p>
<h2>Objective:</h2>
<p>The main goal is to assess and improve the efficiency, reliability, and performance of a queuing system within a computer network. This involves examining how queues are managed, how requests are handled, and optimizing the system to reduce latency, improve throughput, and enhance overall performance.</p>
<h2>Components of the Evaluation:</h2>
<ol>
    <li><b>Queuing Theory Analysis:</b> Understanding the theoretical models governing queues, including arrival rates, service times, queue lengths, and the relationships between these parameters.</li>
    <li><b>System Architecture Review:</b>Examining the architecture of the network/system, including hardware, software, protocols, and their impact on queuing.</li>
